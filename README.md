Bank and payment options
In most cases, each visa applicant, including children, is required to pay a non-refundable, non-transferable Machine Readable Visa (MRV) application fee, whether a visa is issued or not. The visa application fee is determined by the type of visa for which you wish to apply.

Remember, the MRV fee is non-refundable. Please confirm whether or not you need to apply for a visa. You may not need to apply for a new U.S. visa if you already hold a valid U.S. visa or are a national of a Visa Waiver Program participating country.

Certain individuals may not need to pay an MRV fee, for example:

If you are applying for an A or G visa for official travel, you do not need to pay the MRV fee

If you are applying for a J visa to participate in a U.S. Government-sponsored program, you do not need to pay the MRV fee

Certain individuals may not need a visa, for example:

If you already hold a valid visa for your intended purpose of travel, you may not need a visa.

If you are a citizen of Canada or Bermuda (but not applying for an A, E, G, K or V visa category), you may not need a visa.

For more information about fee exemptions, please visit this page.

Remember: Applicants are limited to the number of times they can reschedule their appointments. Please plan accordingly so that you are not required to pay another visa application fee.

Visa fees are not refundable.
